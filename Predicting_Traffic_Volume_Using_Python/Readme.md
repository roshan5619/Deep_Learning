## 🚀 Project Overview

Urban traffic prediction is essential for smarter city planning and congestion management. In this project, we:

- Load and explore real-world traffic volume data
- Prepare time series data for modeling
- Build a neural network using PyTorch
- Train and evaluate the model
- Visualize predictions against ground truth

The approach balances interpretability with performance, making it a great starting point for time series analysis and neural forecasting.
