## ðŸ§  Approach Followed

1. **Preprocessing**
   - Dropped `PassengerId`, `Cabin`, and `Name`
   - Extracted the `Deck` from the `Cabin` column
   - Imputed missing numerical features using median, and categorical using mode
  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Bar plots to explore relationships between features and `Transported`
   - Pie charts for transportation percentages across different `Deck`s
   - Age distribution plotted

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**
   - Used **PCA** to reduce feature space to 2D
   - Visualized the 2D PCA space with color-coded classes

4. **Modeling**
   - Still didn't finished.
